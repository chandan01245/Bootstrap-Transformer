## Project Overview

### Description
Bootstrap Transformer is an innovative tool that simplifies the process of integrating Bootstrap into existing HTML projects. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides ready-to-use components and responsive design features, but converting existing HTML to Bootstrap manually can be time-consuming. Our application automates this conversion, making it easier for developers to upgrade their websites with modern, responsive designs.

### Features
- **HTML to Bootstrap Conversion:** Automatically converts standard HTML code to Bootstrap-compatible HTML.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.
- **Component Support:** Supports conversion of various Bootstrap components such as buttons, forms, navbars, and more.
- **Instant Preview:** Provides an instant preview of the converted code to verify changes.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easy copying of the converted code for quick integration into projects.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Provides the basic structure of the web application.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application. Custom styles are defined in `style.css`.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular front-end framework used to create responsive and modern web designs.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the application. Core logic is handled by `converter.js` and additional functionalities by `script.js`.
- **CodeMirror:** A versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the input and output text areas.

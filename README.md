## Project Overview

### Description
Bootstrap Transformer is an innovative tool that simplifies the process of integrating Bootstrap into existing HTML projects. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides ready-to-use components and responsive design features, but converting existing HTML to Bootstrap manually can be time-consuming. Our application automates this conversion, making it easier for developers to upgrade their websites with modern, responsive designs.

### Features
- **HTML to Bootstrap Conversion:** Automatically converts standard HTML code to Bootstrap-compatible HTML.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.
- **Component Support:** Supports conversion of various Bootstrap components such as buttons, forms, navbars, and more.
- **Instant Preview:** Provides an instant preview of the converted code to verify changes.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easy copying of the converted code for quick integration into projects.

## File Structure and Contents

### 1. `index.html`
The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. It includes the basic structure of the web page, links to the required CSS and JavaScript files, and the user interface elements such as input and output text areas, buttons, and preview sections.

### 2. `style.css`
This CSS file contains custom styles for the application. It ensures that the user interface is visually appealing and consistent. The styles defined here override some of the default Bootstrap styles to enhance the usability and aesthetics of the application.

### 3. `script.js`
The main JavaScript file that handles the logic of the application. It includes functions to:
- Read the input HTML code provided by the user.
- Process and convert the input code to Bootstrap-compliant HTML.
- Update the output text area with the converted code.
- Provide an instant preview of the converted code.
- Handle user interactions such as button clicks and input changes.

### 4. `README.md`
This README file provides detailed documentation about the project, including an overview, features, file structure, and design choices. It serves as a guide for users and contributors to understand the project and its components.

## Design Choices and Considerations

### User Interface Design
The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily input their HTML code, convert it, and preview the results. The layout includes:
- An input text area for users to paste their standard HTML code.
- A "Convert" button to trigger the conversion process.
- An output text area to display the converted Bootstrap HTML code.
- A preview section to display the rendered Bootstrap HTML code.

### Conversion Logic
The conversion logic is implemented in the `script.js` file. It uses regular expressions and string manipulation techniques to identify standard HTML elements and replace them with their Bootstrap equivalents. For example, a standard `<button>` element is converted to a Bootstrap button by adding the appropriate classes (`btn`, `btn-primary`, etc.).

### Instant Preview
To provide an instant preview, the application dynamically updates an iframe with the converted HTML code. This allows users to see the changes in real-time and verify the conversion before copying the code.

### Custom Styles
The `style.css` file includes custom styles to enhance the appearance of the application. These styles ensure that the interface is clean, modern, and user-friendly. The custom styles also ensure compatibility with Bootstrap, preventing conflicts that could arise from default styles.
